# Advanced Functional Features in `tahini`

`tahini` supports several advanced functional programming features that allow for powerful abstractions and code reuse.
This document describes how to use function types, closures, and currying in `tahini`.

## Function Types

In `tahini`, functions are first-class values, meaning they can be:

- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments to functions
- Returned from functions

Function types are specified using the syntax:

```
(fn [param_types] return_type)
```

For example, a function that takes an `i32` and returns an `i32` has type:

```
(fn [i32] i32)
```

A function that takes two `i32` parameters and returns an `i32` has type:

```
(fn [i32 i32] i32)
```

### Function Type Examples

```lisp
;; Define a parameter with a function type
(def apply_to_five (fn [(:f (fn [i32] i32))] i32
  (f 5)
))

;; Pass a function to another function
(def double (fn [(:x i32)] i32 
  (* x 2)
))

(apply_to_five double)  ;; Returns 10
```

## Closures

Closures are functions that capture variables from their defining environment. In `tahini`, when you define a function
inside another function, the inner function can access and capture variables from the outer function.

### Closure Example

```lisp
;; A function that returns a closure
(def make_adder (fn [(:n i32)] (fn [i32] i32)
  ;; This returns a closure that captures n
  (fn [(:x i32)] i32
    (+ x n)
  )
))

;; Create closures with different captured values
(def add5 (make_adder 5))
(def add10 (make_adder 10))

(add5 3)   ;; Returns 8
(add10 3)  ;; Returns 13
```

## Currying

Currying is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each
taking a single argument. `tahini` supports currying through closures.

### Manual Currying Example

```lisp
;; A curried addition function
(def add_curried (fn [(:x i32)] (fn [i32] i32)
  (fn [(:y i32)] i32
    (+ x y)
  )
))

;; Create specialized adders
(def add5 (add_curried 5))

(add5 3)  ;; Returns 8
```

### Generic Curry Function

```lisp
;; A generic curry function for binary functions
(def curry (fn [(:f (fn [i32 i32] i32))] (fn [i32] (fn [i32] i32))
  (fn [(:x i32)] (fn [i32] i32)
    (fn [(:y i32)] i32
      (f x y)
    )
  )
))

;; Regular binary function
(def add (fn [(:x i32) (:y i32)] i32
  (+ x y)
))

;; Curry it
(def curried_add (curry add))
(def add5 (curried_add 5))

(add5 3)  ;; Returns 8
```

## Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that either take functions as arguments or return functions as results (or both).

### Function Composition Example

```lisp
;; Function composition
(def compose (fn [(:f (fn [i32] i32)) (:g (fn [i32] i32))] (fn [i32] i32)
  (fn [(:x i32)] i32
    (g (f x))
  )
))

(def double (fn [(:x i32)] i32 (* x 2)))
(def square (fn [(:x i32)] i32 (* x x)))

;; Compose functions
(def double_then_square (compose double square))

(double_then_square 3)  ;; Returns 36 ((3*2)^2)
```

## Nested Closures and State Management

`tahini` closures can be nested and can maintain state across function calls:

```lisp
;; A counter generator
(def make_counter (fn [(:start i32)] (fn [] i32)
  (do
    ;; Define a mutable count variable
    (def count start)
    
    ;; Return a closure that captures count and increments it
    (fn [] i32
      (do
        (def old_value count)
        (def count (+ count 1))
        old_value
      )
    )
  )
))

;; Create counters
(def counter1 (make_counter 10))
(def counter2 (make_counter 100))

(counter1)  ;; Returns 10, increments to 11
(counter1)  ;; Returns 11, increments to 12
(counter2)  ;; Returns 100, increments to 101
```

## Implementation Notes

Under the hood, closures in `tahini` are implemented as structs containing:

1. A function pointer to the closure implementation
2. Captured environment variables

This allows for efficient execution while maintaining the captured state for each closure instance.
